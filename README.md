# sotoon
Sotoon serves as the foundational architecture for all Nilroad project boilerplates.

## Why "Sotoon"?
#### The name "Sotoon" is derived from a Persian word that translates to "pillar" or "column" in English. We chose this name to represent the core purpose of this boilerplate project: to provide a strong and reliable foundation for your software development, much like how pillars support and stabilize a building.
